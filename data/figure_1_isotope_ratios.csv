# Data description:
# This file contains carbon and oxygen isotope ratio measurements from
# high-resolution infrared spectroscopy and Bayesian atmospheric retrieval
# analysis of M dwarf stars. Isotope ratios are derived from CO molecular
# lines in the K-band using the petitRADTRANS radiative transfer code.
#
# Reference values:
# Solar ¹²C/¹³C = 93.5 ± 3.0 (Ayres et al. 2013)
# Solar ¹⁶O/¹⁸O = 529.7 ± 1.7 (Ayres et al. 2013)
# ISM ¹²C/¹³C = 68.0 ± 14.0 (Milam et al. 2005)
# ISM ¹⁶O/¹⁸O = 557 ± 30 (Wilson et al. 1999)
#
# Methodology:
# - Isotope ratios derived from CO line analysis in K-band spectra
# - Atmospheric retrieval using petitRADTRANS and PyMultiNest
# - Bayesian evidence (ln B) and significance (σ) calculated via nested sampling
# - σ > 3: significant detection, σ < 3: upper limit
# - Uncertainties represent 1-sigma (68% confidence) intervals
#
# Metallicity and alpha enhancement information:
# - [M/H] values from Cristofari et al. (2023), MNRAS, 522, 1342
# - [α/Fe] values from Cristofari et al. (2023), MNRAS, 522, 1342
# - Typical [M/H] uncertainty: ±0.10 dex
# - Typical [α/Fe] uncertainty: ±0.05 dex
